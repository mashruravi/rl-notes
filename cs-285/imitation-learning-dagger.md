# Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning and Dataset Aggregation (WIP)

## Imitation Learning

(*a.k.a Learning by demostration, programming by example*)

A broad term that generally refers to learning from demonstrated behavior.



## Behavioral Cloning

A specific type of imitation learning algorithm where:

- We have access to an expert that already knows how to perform the task.
- We watch the expert performing the task, and log actions that the expert takes and the situations (observations) that make the expert take those actions.
- We use supervised learning to learn actions from observations.



How well this approach works depends on:

1. How good the expert is.
2. How good the supervised learning (multiclass classification to be precise) algorithm we use is.



## Dataset Aggregation (DAGGER)
